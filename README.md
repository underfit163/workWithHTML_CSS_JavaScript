# workWithHTML_CSS_JavaScript
In the process of developing a tutorial application, familiarize yourself with creating an html page using CSS.

Develop html pages for data input and for output of the result.
The first page should be called index.html. It should contain:
- title,
- accompanying text,
- two fields for entering data to perform the operation,
- prompts (hints) to these input fields,
- radio buttons with four arithmetic operations,
- a button to complete the input (with a transition to result.html).

The second page should be called result.html. It should contain:
- title,
- the values of the arguments and the result of the operation, formatted as a table,
- your favorite photo,
- a link to the source page that changes color when the cursor hovers over it.

Both pages should be designed using CSS. The style sheet (common for both pages)and the JavaScript code should be placed in separate files. All elements of both pages should change their appearance in accordance with the styles (the design is at your discretion).
